The SQL File provided here Creates the Environment to make the SQL Requests from the PHP Scripts work.
It also Creates some Dummy data, which you dont Need to create, These are just for my uni module.
I am using MAMP, C# Scripts direct to a URL which is the Destination of the parent Folder/ the Script Name.
Since the PHP Files are in this Project, you Need to go to your HTDOCS Folder and create the worldbuilding parent Folder
In there you have to create hardlinks that Point to the PHP Files that are in this Unity Project.

Thank you for your interest :)!
