The SQL File provided here creates the Environment to make the SQL Requests from the PHP Scripts work.
It also creates some dummy-data, which you dont need to include, these are just for my data analytics module.
I am using MAMP as a local Server. C# Scripts direct to an URL which is the destination of the parent Folder/ the Script Name.
Since the PHP Files are in this Repository folder, you need to go to your HTDOCS Folder, create the worldbuilding parent Folder,
and create hardlinks that point to the PHP files that are in this Repository.

Thank you for your interest :)!
